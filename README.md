# speak2do
voice controlled task manager
Thrilled to introduce Speak2Do – my latest project that transforms the way we interact with our laptops.
Speak2Do is a voice-controlled productivity assistant that goes beyond task management. With simple voice commands, it can:
Create, update, and track tasks
Search the web instantly
Open applications and files
Adjust system volume
Restart or shut down the system
…and much more.
The vision for Speak2Do is to grow into a comprehensive AI-powered desktop assistant — capable of learning user habits, supporting multiple languages, integrating with productivity tools, and personalizing workflows.
